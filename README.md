## Abstract

This project presents the design and implementation of an IoT-based smart garage system that automates vehicle detection and garage door control while providing real-time user feedback through an integrated mobile application. The system is equipped with an ultrasonic sensor to detect the presence of a car within the garage, a servo motor to open and close the garage door, and a combination of a buzzer and an LED to provide audio-visual notifications during door operations.

The Blynk IoT platform is utilized to enable remote control and monitoring, allowing users to operate the garage door and receive status updates from anywhere. When the ultrasonic sensor detects the carâ€™s presence, the status is displayed on the Blynk app, and users can remotely control the servo motor to open or close the door. Additionally, the buzzer and LED activate as feedback mechanisms, ensuring the system is user-friendly and accessible.

This project demonstrates the integration of IoT technologies with hardware components to create a practical, efficient, and scalable solution for smart home automation. It underscores the benefits of automation in improving convenience, security, and functionality, showcasing the transformative potential of IoT in everyday applications.
